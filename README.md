## Prework Study Guide

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 

 To try and expand my skill set.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

 I built it to help me study for my upcoming class as a practice for what's to come. I want to be able to try, fail and try again. I've done that several times and cried with frustration during this process.

- What problem does it solve? 

It solves my study guide issue of writing everything down. Instead it's here showing me I am able to do this and so can anyone else.

- What did you learn? 

I learned how to use command, it's a bit rough. I'm learning about Java and HTML, CSS and git. Everything is new and very intimidating.


## Installation

Theres nothing to do to install the project, it's a live site.

## Usage

Each section has a few notes about topics like HTML or CSS. if youre able to open DevTools which is conviently built into chrome you can see javascript running which is neat and it wasn't something i was aware you could do. Going through the guide helps make it a little less scary and breaks it down so its a little easier to understand.
